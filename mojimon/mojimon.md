# App Idea
- Mojimon (Emoji + Mon, like Pokemon)
- A SwiftUI-based RPG
- Could incoporate elements of rouge, rougelights, text-based RPGs, etc 

## Notes
- Reusable Systems (in Mac, iOS, TV, and watch)
    - Grid
    - Moving around
- the world is a grid
- The world tiles are randomly generated
- Moves are turn based and are acquired overtime
- Use Swift UI to declaratively render the grid based on the users positions and other world state
- Tapping or selecting a cardinal direction; diagonal movement can be unlocked?
- You can traverse X and Y and the find ladders, stairs, etc that can change your Z
- You could buy markers that you can place at positions (game is free though)
- Add emoji creatures that you can encounter 🦆🦅🦉🦇🐛🦋🐌🐞🐜🦟🦗🕷🦂🐢🐍🦎🦖🦕🐙🦑🦐🦞🦀🐡🐠🐟🐬🐳🐋🦈🐊🐅🐆🦓🦍🦧🐘🦛🦏🐪🐫🦒🦘🐃🐂🐄🐖🐏🐑🦙🐐🦌🐕🦡🐓🦃🦚🦜🦢🐈🦩🐇🦝🦨🦡🐁🐀🦔
- On encounters have a hell nice card/tile flip animation on the center tile
- Creatures can be trained by mini games? Or maybe something other than a battle system for now
- Objects you can find in the wild 🪓💊🔑📃📔🍏🍐(all the fruits and trees) 🦴🛶🕳🚪 🎁 🔨🗡🔪⚰️📦
